*Â These SPICE models model the nominal behavior within the limitations

*
*Â While the models strive to match actual device performance, not all
* aspects of the performance of these models may correspond to actual
* device behavior due to SPICE limitations.
* 
*Â Simulations using these models should not be used to prove validity
* of circuit design or any aspects of performance, due to inherent
* inaccuracies of SPICE models. 
*
*Â All simulations should be checked and correlated with actual bench
* measurements of typical devices.
